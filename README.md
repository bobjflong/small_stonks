# small_stonks

A menu-bar application for macOS, which ticks through a list of stock symbols, giving their current price. This app is implemented with Typescript and Electron.

# Usage

Requires a free API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key).

```
yarn start --stocks=MSFT,TWLO,SPY,AAPL --apiKey=<api key>
```

The `--duration` parameter is also supported, to change how long each price is displayed for. However free Alpha Vantage accounts have low rate limits, so YMMV in terms of accuracy. The app will try to fall back to a previous price if none is returned by the API.

Clicking the menu bar item, will open the current stock in Yahoo Finance, eg: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWLO/.

# Warning

Please don't use this app for anything important, or making important decisions ðŸ™„ I cannot vouch for accuracy. The data here is calculated from daily snapshots, not real-time. This is due to some limitations of Alpha Vantage. I would like to add real time data in the future.
